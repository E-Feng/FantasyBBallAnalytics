My first and personal project involving my hobby of basketball and fantasy sports. Using the API provided by ESPN, I created an ETL datapipeline to create interesting visuals to provide better informed decisions. These include daily alerts of high scoring games and color coded tables to show teams strengths and weaknesses. This project was first written in vanilla javascript using Windows scheduler to run Python scripts. Later it was fully rewritten using modern web designs and serverless methods with React, Apache Airflow, Lambda, DynamoDB, and hosted on Google Cloud Platform using Docker containers.
